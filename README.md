# conwaysGameOfLife
Interactive web application solving a classic puzzle

--Instructions on how to build, test, run--
This Maven dynamic web page project was built in the Eclipse IDE. I would recommend running it on a server through an IDE.

Build
In order to do this you will need to import the project into your IDE as an existing Maven project. The current runtime environment is Apache Tomcat 8.5. You may need to change this to the server you will be running it out of. In Eclipse this is under project Properties > Project Facets > Runtimes then select your server and deselect the current server. Once this is complete you will need to run the project on the server and the web page will load. 
Test
In order to run the unit tests out of your Java IDE, simply run the project as JUnit Test.

Run
Once the server is hosting it enter http://localhost:8080/ConwaysGameOfLife1/ into the Google Chrome search bar.
